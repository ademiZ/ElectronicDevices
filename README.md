The Device Manager is a JavaFX-based application designed to manage different types of devices using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
The program models three types of devices — Smartphone, Laptop, and Tablet — by implementing inheritance through a shared base class.
Users can interact with the devices through a graphical user interface (GUI) to add, view, and remove them from a list.
